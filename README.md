# Ownership and Borrowing in Rust ðŸ¦€

This project explores one of the most important and unique features of the Rust programming language â€” **Ownership** and **Borrowing**.

## ðŸ“˜ About

Rust uses an ownership system to manage memory safely and efficiently without a garbage collector. This project provides simple examples and explanations for how ownership, borrowing, and references work in Rust.

It includes:

- âœ… Basic ownership rules
- âœ… Moving vs copying
- âœ… Borrowing with references
- âœ… Mutable vs immutable references
- âœ… Lifetimes (coming soon!)
