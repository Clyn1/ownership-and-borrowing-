# Ownership and Borrowing in Rust ðŸ¦€

This project explores one of the most important and unique features of the Rust programming language â€” Ownership and Borrowing.

## ðŸ“˜ About

Rust uses an ownership system to manage memory safely and efficiently without a garbage collector. This project provides simple examples and explanations for how ownership, borrowing, and references work in Rust. It includes: âœ… Basic ownership rules âœ… Moving vs copying âœ… Borrowing with references âœ… Mutable vs immutable references âœ… Lifetimes (coming soon!)
